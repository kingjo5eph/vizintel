                    <p>The Property Taxes by State and County Report for 2021 and 2022 captures a total revenue of
                      $11.22 million, underscoring property taxes’ pivotal role in funding U.S. local services and
                      infrastructure. The West leads with $2,640,216 in revenue, reflecting strong economic momentum
                      with a $133,314 year-over-year increase.

                      <p>
                        Following closely, the Northeast generated $2,268,166 with a variance of $100,542, indicative of
                        steady growth, while the Midwest and Southeast also contributed robustly. The Southwest, though
                        reporting the least revenue, shows positive incremental gains.

                      <p>
                        Urban areas drive higher property tax revenues due to elevated property values and population
                        density, as seen in states like New York, New Jersey, and California.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Conversely, rural counties in Alaska and Louisiana, with lower property values and smaller tax
                        bases, contribute modestly.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Effective tax rates reveal further geographic variation, with states such as New Jersey and
                        Illinois at the high end and states like Hawaii and Alabama maintaining lower rates, largely
                        influenced by state policies and local budget needs.

                    <p>Total U.S. property tax revenue rose by $436,439 from 2021 to 2022, reflecting nationwide
                      economic growth. The West region’s substantial increase set the pace, while the Northeast and
                      Southeast showed stable growth patterns, each contributing significantly to overall revenues.

                      <p>
                        High-population states—Texas, New York, and California—saw notable revenue increases driven by
                        rising property values and economic expansion. Conversely, smaller states like Rhode Island
                        displayed moderate gains, highlighting economic concentration in populous areas.

                      <p>
                        Geographic disparities in property tax rates reveal sharp contrasts. Counties near New York City
                        and in New Jersey feature median payments exceeding $10,000 due to high property values and
                        service demands, while counties in Alaska and Louisiana show some of the lowest payments,
                        aligned with reduced property values and budget needs.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Urban counties with dense populations and high property values significantly drive state tax
                        revenues, while rural counties, especially in Montana and South Dakota, generate lower revenues,
                        illustrating the crucial economic role urban areas play in local funding.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Counties in New Jersey and New York exhibit the highest property tax rates, reflecting high
                        service costs and elevated property values. Conversely, the lowest rates are observed in Alaska
                        and Louisiana, where service costs and property values are comparatively low.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Effective tax rates vary due to assessment ratios and millage rates, with high millage rates
                        often driving higher taxes. This supports the benefit principle in public finance, where
                        taxpayers directly benefit from services funded by these revenues.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This underscores the influence of economic conditions, property values, and local policies on
                        property tax revenues across the U.S., providing critical insights to guide regional financial
                        planning and address local disparities effectively.

                    <p>The global energy sector is undergoing a major transformation as countries work to balance energy
                      security, economic growth, and environmental sustainability. Historically, fossil fuels like oil,
                      coal, and natural gas have dominated energy investments, fueling industries and homes for decades.
                      However, these sources have also significantly contributed to greenhouse gas emissions and climate
                      change. In 2024, there’s a noticeable shift toward clean energy technologies as governments and
                      corporations recognize the need for sustainable solutions.

                        Investment trends are changing as more entities acknowledge the finite nature of fossil fuels
                        and their environmental impact. Renewable energy sources—such as solar, wind, and hydro—are
                        receiving increased investment driven by supportive policies, technological advancements, and a
                        global push for sustainability. This dual challenge of ensuring reliable energy while
                        transitioning to low-carbon systems is shaping the current energy investment landscape.

                      <p>
                        From 2015 to 2024, global energy investments have significantly increased, especially post-2020,
                        as the focus shifted toward renewable energy. Initially stable, investments surged due to the
                        heightened attention on climate goals and economic recovery after the pandemic. Renewable are
                        now the leading sector for global energy investment, reflecting efforts to meet emissions
                        reduction targets.

                      <p>
                        Key factors driving this increase include the transition to clean energy, government incentives,
                        technological innovations, and rising energy demand due to economic recovery. Advanced
                        economies, particularly in Europe and North America, are leading in clean energy investments,

                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <strong>Investor Owned Utility Market Share:</strong> IOUs lead in revenue generation due to
                        their larger scale, extensive infrastructure, and capital investments, especially in densely
                        populated urban and suburban areas. Conversely, cooperatives and municipal utilities maintain

                      <p>
                        <strong>Infrastructure and Pricing Pressures:</strong> Aging infrastructure drives
                        inefficiencies and cost increases, especially in residential and industrial sectors.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <strong>Seasonal and Industrial Demand:</strong> Extreme weather impacts residential demand in
                        urban areas, while industrial reliance on affordable energy underscores vulnerability to grid
                        disruptions.

                    <p>The dental care market in the USA features four primary plans: PPO (Preferred Provider
                      Organization), EPO (Exclusive Provider Organization), HMO (Health Maintenance Organization), and
                      Indemnity. Each offers unique features and sub-plans, with family plans often preferred due to
                      their comprehensive coverage and cost-effectiveness.
                    </p>
                    <div class="collapse multi-collapse" id="dental_overview">

                      <p>
                        <strong>PPO</strong> Plans are popular for their flexibility in choosing providers. They include
                        a standard PPO, which offers varying coverage based on network status, and an enhanced PPO that
                        covers additional services like orthodontics. High revenues from PPO plans, especially in Texas,
                        highlight their strong demand due to a large population and employer offerings.

                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <strong>EPO</strong> Plans have a narrower network and typically cover in-network services only.
                        They come in a basic EPO for essential care and a comprehensive EPO with added benefits.
                        Families often prefer these for lower premiums, although they must stay within the network.

                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <strong>HMO</strong> Plans require members to choose a primary dentist and get referrals for
                        specialists. Standard HMOs focus on basic services, while comprehensive HMOs include more
                        extensive procedures. Families appreciate the predictable costs and comprehensive care options
                        these plans provide.

                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <strong>Indemnity</strong> Plans offer the most freedom in choosing providers but usually come
                        with higher costs. They include traditional indemnity plans and managed indemnity plans, which
                        blend features of PPOs and indemnities. While appealing for their flexibility, they are often
                        less popular with families due to higher out-of-pocket expenses.

                      accessibility to dental care. Plan availability also differs, with larger states generally

                        Dental care issuers vary by region, with some companies dominating specific areas. Access to
                        plans can depend on geographic location, influencing consumer choices.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        States like Texas, Florida, and California generate the highest revenues due to larger
                        populations and more employers providing dental benefits, reflecting a robust dental market.

                        In summary, the USA's dental care landscape offers diverse plans with family options preferred
                        for their comprehensive coverage and cost benefits. Understanding the variations in plan types
                        and regional differences is crucial for consumers seeking quality dental care.

                        Operational projects provide strong investment opportunities, but challenges related to
                        regulatory frameworks and energy efficiency need addressing to attract further investment.

                      <p>
                        The mining industry is energy-intensive, primarily relying on coal, but integrating renewable
                        energy sources and improving energy management practices can enhance sustainability and reduce
                        operational costs.

                        While Southern Africa remains dominant in the mining landscape, West and Central Africa are
                        emerging as new opportunities due to their untapped reserves. The development of infrastructure
                        in these regions is vital for attracting investments.

                        As the global market shifts toward renewable technologies, the demand for critical minerals
                        continues to grow, and Africa is well-positioned to meet this demand, contributing significantly
                        to economic growth and development.

                    <p>The Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) from 2019 to 2023 reveals significant shifts due to
                      factors like political instability, economic crises, and the COVID-19 pandemic. While some
                      countries made progress in governance, others struggled with worsening corruption and weak

                        Western countries, especially in Europe and North America, largely maintained strong
                        transparency and low corruption perceptions. However, Eastern Europe, Africa, and parts of Asia
                        saw declines due to entrenched corruption, political instability, and inadequate reforms. The
                        pandemic, in particular, exposed governance vulnerabilities, contributing to higher corruption
                        perceptions, especially in countries with less transparency and accountability in their COVID-19

                      issues related to political polarization and institutional trust, affecting its CPI ranking.
                      Canada, on the other hand, maintained its position as one of the least corrupt countries globally.

                          <u>Europe: Western vs. Eastern</u> - Western Europe remained a leader in governance and
                          transparency, with countries like Denmark, Finland, and Sweden occupying top spots. In
                          contrast, Eastern Europe showed significant disparity, with nations like Russia, Hungary, and
                          Bulgaria experiencing stagnation or decline in their CPI rankings. These countries struggled
                          with post-Soviet governance legacies, political instability, and oligarchic influence, while
                          nations like Poland and Estonia made gradual improvements.

                          Zimbabwe, remained mired in corruption due to political instability and weak governance
                          frameworks. While some African nations made strides in addressing corruption, the continent
                          overall faced significant challenges, exacerbated by historical inequalities and economic
                          instability.

                          South Asia faced entrenched corruption and governance issues. Countries like Indonesia and the
                          Philippines saw declines, linked to political instability and weak rule of law. Central Asia,
                          with countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, also struggled due to authoritarian regimes and
                          limited reforms.

                          countries like Papua New Guinea and Fiji faced challenges related to weak governance and
                          institutional transparency, leading to relatively lower CPI scores for the region.

                        <p>
                          The CPI from 2019 to 2023 highlighted the ongoing global struggle against corruption. While
                          Western Europe and North America showed resilience, Eastern Europe, Africa, and parts of Asia
                          struggled with entrenched corruption, political instability, and weak governance. The COVID-19
                          pandemic further exposed the vulnerability of many systems to corruption, especially in
                          countries with limited transparency.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The period also showed that anti-corruption efforts can succeed, as seen in South Africa,
                          Georgia, and Estonia, where reforms and political will led to improved governance. However,
                          countries like Russia, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe continued to face significant challenges in
                          tackling corruption.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The data underscores the need for continued global efforts to promote transparency,
                          accountability, and good governance to combat corruption effectively, especially in regions
                          where institutions remain weak or under threat.

          <h1>Complaints Policy</h1>
          <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 01/01/2025</p>

          <h2>Our Policy</h2>
          <p>
            The intention of this policy is to ensure that all complaints from research participants are handled
            efficiently and effectively.
            This policy covers formal complaints from participants who have engaged with or received a call or other
            contact by Vizintel as part of a survey.
          </p>

          <h2>Exceptions</h2>
          <p>
            Data Subject Access Requests are not covered by this Complaint Handling Policy. Participants should instead
            refer to our
            <a href="link-to-privacy-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Statement</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vizintel will not consider a complaint if there are active legal proceedings ongoing relating to the same
            issue. Vizintel reserves
            the right to disapply this policy to any complaint submitted if it considers it reasonable to do so.
          </p>
          <p>If your complaint is about a client company's business, please contact that client directly.</p>

          <h2>Stage 1 - Formal Written Complaint</h2>
          <p>
            In most cases, a complaint or issue can be resolved during the initial contact by Vizintel explaining who we
            are and why we are/were
            contacting you. To find out more about how we use your personal information, check our
            <a href="link-to-privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are not satisfied that your questions or issues have been addressed to your satisfaction, you can
            submit a formal written
            complaint to <a href="mailto:compliance@Vizintel.com">compliance@Vizintel.com</a>. To allow us to understand
            your complaint and investigate it fully, you should set out:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A description of the nature of your complaint.</li>
            <li>Any relevant facts, dates, and the name(s) of individual(s) involved.</li>
            <li>The telephone number or email address that you were originally contacted on (without this, we may not be
              able to deal with the complaint).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The project manager and/or project director will investigate the complaint. The extent of the investigation
            will depend on the
            nature of the complaint and may include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Requesting further information from you about your complaint.</li>
            <li>Liaising with external parties, including the client.</li>
            <li>Interviewing relevant Vizintel staff.</li>
            <li>Reviewing emails or call recordings.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            By submitting a formal complaint, participants acknowledge that Vizintel may be required to share
            information about the participant
            and the complaint with external third parties to thoroughly investigate the complaint.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project manager and/or project director will provide a written outcome of the investigation by email. We
            endeavour to respond
            within 15 working days from when we receive the complaint. If it is not reasonably practicable to respond
            fully within this time,
            we will provide an interim response with an estimated timeframe for a full response.
          </p>



          <h2>Stage 2 - Appeal</h2>
          <p>
            If dissatisfied with the outcome, you can ask for the decision to be reviewed. You must email the project
            manager and/or project
            director who provided the initial outcome, confirming your desire to appeal the decision and setting out
            your full grounds for
            appeal. Appeals must be submitted within 10 working days of receiving the initial outcome. If no appeal
            request is received by the
            deadline, the original decision remains final.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Business Assurance Committee will review the complainant's grounds of appeal. Their decision is final,
            and this will conclude
            the procedure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the handling of the complaint, Vizintel will keep internal records of actions taken. These
            records will be maintained in
            line with our data protection procedures as set out in our
            <a href="link-to-privacy-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Statement</a>.
          </p>

              manner. In the event of any delays in the Client’s provision of such assistance as agreed by the parties,
              Vizintel shall be entitled to adjust any agreed timetable or delivery schedule as reasonably necessary;
            </li>
            <li><strong>c)</strong> provide Vizintel with full and clear instructions as to its requirements for the
              Services and all information, materials and assistance required for the proper performance of the
              Services;</li>
            <li><strong>d)</strong> promptly supply to Vizintel (at no charge) any Client Materials reasonably required
              by Vizintel or otherwise necessary to provide the Services and shall ensure that all Client Data is
              provided in a secure and encrypted form;</li>
            <li><strong>e)</strong> obtain and maintain in force throughout the Term all necessary licences, consents
              and permissions necessary for Vizintel, its sub-contractors and agents to use the Client Materials and
              perform their obligations under this Agreement, including the Services;</li>
            <li><strong>f)</strong> comply with and, where the Services include any Subscription Service, procure that
              each Authorised User complies with, all applicable laws and regulations with respect to its activities
              under this Agreement;</li>
            <li><strong>g)</strong> use the Services only for the purposes for which they were provided, and not modify
              or alter any material or information provided by Vizintel without Vizintel’s written consent;</li>
            <li><strong>h)</strong> keep Vizintel informed of any matters related to the Client which will, or could,
              have an impact on Vizintel’s performance of the Services;</li>
            <li><strong>i)</strong> promptly inform Vizintel if the Client considers that any Services or materials
              provided to the Client by Vizintel for approval are false or misleading or in any way contrary to
              applicable law; and</li>
            <li><strong>j)</strong> ensure that the Client’s other suppliers, contractors and agents cooperate with
              Vizintel as reasonably necessary to enable Vizintel to perform the Services;</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>5.3</strong> If the Client does not fulfil its obligations under or in connection with this
            Agreement (including its payment obligations), then to the extent that such failure prevents Vizintel from
            performing any Services in accordance with this Agreement, Vizintel will be relieved of its obligations to
            the Client, and Vizintel shall not be liable for any losses, costs or expenses incurred by the Client as a
            result of any such failure.</p>
          <h2>6. FEES</h2>

          <p><strong>6.1</strong> In consideration of the provision of the Services by Vizintel, the Client shall pay
            the Fees to Vizintel together with any Expenses.</p>

          <p><strong>6.2</strong> If it is agreed that work shall be undertaken by Vizintel outside the scope of the
            Statement of Work, Vizintel will charge for such work by time spent and in accordance with the hourly rates
            listed in Vizintel’s prevailing rate card as may be communicated to the Client from time to time.</p>

          <p><strong>6.3</strong> Any Expenses incurred and not set out in the Statement of Work will be agreed in
            advance with the Client.</p>

          <p><strong>6.4</strong> Unless set out otherwise in the Statement of Work, the Fees and (if applicable) the
            Expenses shall be invoiced to the Client monthly in advance. Where applicable, VAT will be charged to the
            Client at the prevailing rate.</p>

          <p><strong>6.5</strong> Unless set out otherwise in the Statement of Work, the Client shall pay Vizintel in
            full and in cleared funds within 30 days of the date of each invoice.</p>

          <p><strong>6.6</strong> In the event that the Services are cancelled (including in the event of termination of
            the Agreement for convenience in accordance with clause 15), Vizintel will charge the Client an amount
            (“Cancellation Charge”) equal to the greater of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>a)</strong> 10% of the total Fee or £2,000 (whichever is lower); or</li>
            <li><strong>b)</strong> A fee based on work undertaken up to the date of cancellation, calculated by
              incorporating costs incurred (including any cancellation or committed charges payable) and estimated time
              committed to date, which shall be payable in accordance with this clause 6.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>6.7</strong> In the event of any amendment to the Statement of Work by the Client (as agreed
            between the parties):</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>a)</strong> the Fees payable to Vizintel in respect of the amended Services shall not decrease
              below the level of Fees that would have been payable had the Services not been amended, save with the
              prior written approval of Vizintel; and</li>
            <li><strong>b)</strong> the Client shall reimburse Vizintel for any costs and other charges or expenses to
              which Vizintel is committed as a result of the amendment, including but not limited to any cancellation
              charges imposed by suppliers.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>6.8</strong> Without prejudice to any other right or remedy that it may have, Vizintel may charge
            interest on any overdue sum from the due date for payment at an annual rate of 4% above the base lending
            rate from time to time of Barclays Bank plc, accruing daily from the due date for payment until the date on
            which Vizintel receives payment together with all accrued interest. Vizintel may also, without liability to
            the Client, suspend the Services (including, with respect to any Subscription Service, disabling the
            Client’s and/or the Authorised Users’ passwords, account and access to all or part of the Platform) until
            payment for overdue sums has been made in full, during which period, the Fees will remain payable in full.
          </p>

          <p><strong>6.9</strong> If any payment of the Fees (including any Cancellation Charge) and Expenses is subject
            to tax (whether by way of direct assessment or withholding at its source), Vizintel shall be entitled to
            receive from the Client such amounts as shall ensure that the net receipt to Vizintel of the Fees (including
            any Cancellation Charge) and Expenses after tax in respect of the payment is the same as it would have been
            were the payment not subject to such tax.</p>

          <p><strong>6.10</strong> If Vizintel is required to purchase anything other than in pounds sterling, it shall
            charge the Client at the exchange rate (which shall be the mid-point rate as quoted in the following day’s
            Financial Times) in operation on the date on which Vizintel makes the purchase. If Vizintel is required to
            invoice the Client other than in pounds sterling, the amounts shall be calculated in pounds sterling, and
            shall be charged to the Client based on the exchange-rate in operation on the date on which Vizintel issues
            the invoice (which shall be the mid-point rate as quoted in the following day’s Financial Times), unless set
            out otherwise in the Statement of Work.</p>

          <h2>7. APPROVALS</h2>

          <p><strong>7.1</strong> For the purposes of this Agreement, any reference to “written approval” shall include
            letter, e-mail, purchase order, or the Client’s signature on a particular document that has been submitted
            for approval.</p>

          <p><strong>7.2</strong> Vizintel may rely on written approval from any employee of the Client, unless the
            Client has previously provided written notice in the manner stipulated by clause 7 that a particular
            employee is not authorised to give valid written approval.</p>

          <p><strong>7.3</strong> The Client hereby indemnifies, and keeps indemnified, Vizintel against any costs,
            claims or proceedings, or demands, arising out of or in connection with anything approved in writing by the
            Client.</p>

          <p><strong>7.4</strong> In the event of any delay or failure of the Client giving approvals (or disapprovals)
            requested under or in connection with this Agreement, Vizintel will not be liable for any resulting delays
            or adverse impact caused to the delivery of any Services.</p>

          <h2>8. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</h2>

          <p><strong>8.1</strong> Vizintel acknowledges that ownership of Client Materials and ownership of all
            Intellectual Property Rights in any Client Materials (including any modifications or adaptations of such
            Client Materials produced in the course of providing the Services) shall remain vested in the Client or its
            licensors. The Client hereby grants to Vizintel a non-exclusive licence during the Term to use the Client
            Materials solely for the purposes of providing the Services.</p>

          <p><strong>8.2</strong> Subject to the remaining provisions of this clause 8 and Vizintel receiving payment of
            all Fees attributable to Created Materials, Vizintel hereby assigns to the Client (and in the case of
            copyright, by way of a present assignment of future copyright) all of the Intellectual Property Rights in
            Created Materials which are capable of being assigned together with the right to sue for past infringement
            of the Intellectual Property Rights in Created Materials.</p>

          <p><strong>8.3</strong> The Client acknowledges that all Intellectual Property Rights in Vizintel Proprietary
            Materials shall be owned by and remain the property of and vested in Vizintel. Subject to Vizintel receiving
            payment of all Fees attributable to Vizintel Proprietary Materials licensed under this clause 8, Vizintel
            hereby grants to the Client a licence to use such Vizintel Proprietary Materials as are included in the
            final, approved Deliverables provided by Vizintel under the Statement of Work, in the Territory, for the
            period of time and for the purposes set out in the Statement of Work. Except as expressly stated, this
            Agreement does not grant the Client any rights to, or in, patents, copyright, database rights, trade
            secrets, trade names, trademarks (whether registered or unregistered), or any other rights or licences in
            respect of the Services or the Insights.</p>

          <p><strong>8.4</strong> Prior to delivery of any materials to be provided by Vizintel under the Statement of
            Work, Vizintel shall obtain such licences or consents in respect of Third Party Materials as shall be
            necessary in order that the Client can use such Third Party Materials for the purposes set out in the
            Statement of Work. Vizintel shall notify the Client of any restrictions on usage and any other contractual
            restrictions arising in respect of such Third Party Materials, and the Client hereby indemnifies, and keeps
            indemnified, Vizintel against any losses, costs, and expenses suffered by Vizintel as a result of the Client
            or its Affiliates breaching any such restrictions.</p>

          <p><strong>8.5</strong> Vizintel agrees, at the Client’s request and expense, to take all such actions and
            execute all such documents as are necessary (in the Client’s reasonable opinion) to enable the Client to
            obtain, defend, or enforce its rights in the Deliverables, and shall not do or fail to do any act which
            would or might prejudice the Client’s rights under this clause 8.</p>

          <p><strong>8.6</strong> Notwithstanding any of the above and save as otherwise expressly provided for in the
            Statement of Work, Vizintel shall:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>a)</strong> be able during and after the Term to use any Deliverables which have been broadcast,
              published, distributed, or otherwise made available to the public, and the Client’s name and logo for the
              purposes of promoting its work and its business including on Vizintel’s website, in credentials pitches,
              and in its showreel. Any other use by Vizintel shall be subject to the Client’s prior approval; and</li>
            <li><strong>b)</strong> retain all know-how obtained in connection with the Services, and the Client
              acknowledges that nothing in this Agreement shall affect Vizintel’s right to use as it sees fit any
              general intelligence or any aggregated data gained by Vizintel in the course of its appointment.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>8.7</strong> For the avoidance of doubt, Vizintel shall not be liable under or in connection with
            this Agreement for any modifications, adaptations, or amendments to any Deliverables made by the Client or
            by a third party on the Client’s behalf, nor in the event that any fault, error, destruction, or other
            degradation in the quality and/or quantity of the Deliverables arises due to the acts or omissions of the
            Client and/or its Associates.</p>
          <h2>9. CONFIDENTIALITY</h2>

          <p><strong>9.1</strong> Each of the parties acknowledges that, whether by virtue of and in the course of this
            Agreement or otherwise, it may receive or otherwise become aware of information relating to the other party,
            its clients, customers, businesses, staff, business plans, or affairs, which information is proprietary and
            confidential to the other party (“Confidential Information”).</p>

          <p><strong>9.2</strong> Confidential Information shall include any document marked “Confidential”, or any
            information which the recipient has been informed is confidential or which it ought reasonably to expect the
            other party would regard as confidential.</p>

          <p><strong>9.3</strong> Confidential Information shall exclude information which:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>a)</strong> at the time of receipt by the recipient is in the public domain;</li>
            <li><strong>b)</strong> subsequently comes into the public domain through no fault of the recipient, its
              officers, employees or agents;</li>
            <li><strong>c)</strong> is lawfully received by the recipient from a third party on an unrestricted basis;
              and/or</li>
            <li><strong>d)</strong> is already known to the recipient before receipt hereunder.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>9.4</strong> Each of the parties undertakes to maintain the confidentiality of the other party’s
            Confidential Information at all times and to use no less adequate measures than it uses in respect of its
            own confidential information to keep the other party’s Confidential Information reasonably secure. Neither
            party shall at any time, whether during the Term or thereafter, without the prior written approval of the
            other party, use, disclose, exploit, copy, or modify any of the other party’s Confidential Information, or
            authorise or permit any third party to do the same, other than for the sole purpose of the exercise of its
            rights and/or the performance of its obligations in connection with this Agreement.</p>

          <p><strong>9.5</strong> Each of the parties undertakes to disclose the other party’s Confidential Information
            only to those of its Associates to whom, and to the extent to which, such disclosure is necessary for the
            purposes contemplated under this Agreement.</p>

          <p><strong>9.6</strong> Neither party shall be in breach of this clause 9 if it discloses the other party’s
            Confidential Information in circumstances where such disclosure is required by law, regulation or order of a
            competent authority, provided that, to the extent practicable and permissible, the other party is given
            reasonable advance notice of the intended disclosure and a reasonable opportunity to challenge the same.</p>

          <p><strong>9.7</strong> The terms of and obligations imposed by this clause 9 shall survive the termination of
            this Agreement for any reason.</p>

          <h2>10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>

          <p><strong>10.1</strong> Subject to clause 10.2, Vizintel’s maximum aggregate liability under or in connection
            with this Agreement (including all Statements of Work):</p>

              payable by the Client to Vizintel in the 12-month period preceding any event giving rise to liability; and

          </ul>

          <p><strong>10.2</strong> Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or in any way limit either party’s liability
            for fraud, death or personal injury caused by negligence or any other liability to the extent such liability
            may not be excluded or limited as a matter of law.</p>

          <p><strong>10.3</strong> Subject to clause 10.2, neither party shall be liable to the other, whether in
            contract, tort (including negligence), for breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, arising under or in
            connection with this Agreement (and including for the avoidance of doubt any indemnity contained in this
            Agreement) for:</p>
          <ul>

              for direct loss, costs, damages, charges, or expenses).</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>10.4</strong> Where one party (“Indemnifying Party”) agrees to indemnify and keep the other party
            (“Indemnified Party”) indemnified under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall comply with the
            following process in the event that a third-party claim (“Claim”) arises:</p>

              compromise without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party;</li>
            <li><strong>c)</strong> the Indemnified Party must give the Indemnifying Party express authority to conduct
              all negotiations and litigation and to defend and/or settle all litigation arising from such Claim,
              provided that the Indemnifying Party regularly consults the Indemnified Party on the conduct and defence
              of the Claim;</li>
            <li><strong>d)</strong> the Indemnified Party must provide the Indemnifying Party with all available
              information and assistance in relation to such Claim as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably require at
              the Indemnifying Party’s cost and expense; and</li>
            <li><strong>e)</strong> if within ninety (90) days after the Indemnifying Party’s receipt of notice of any
              such claim, the Indemnifying Party fails to take action to defend or settle such claim, the Indemnified
              Party may at the Indemnifying Party’s expense undertake the defence, compromise, or settlement of the
              Claim as it sees fit.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>10.5</strong> The Client acknowledges that any Subscription Service and the Insights are provided
            to the Client on an "as is" basis, and accordingly, the Client assumes sole responsibility for the results

            information, instructions or scripts provided to Vizintel by the Client in connection with the Services, or
            any actions taken by Vizintel at the Client’s direction.</p>

          <p><strong>10.7</strong> Save as expressly set out in this Agreement, all warranties, representations,

          <p><strong>13.2</strong> Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies which either party may have, either

              to appoint one), or enters into any compromise or arrangement with its creditors or is the subject of a
              notice, resolution or order for or in connection with its winding-up (other than for the sole purpose of a
              solvent amalgamation or solvent reconstruction); or</li>
            <li><strong>e)</strong> any event occurs, or proceeding is taken, with respect to the other party in any
              jurisdiction to which it is subject that has an effect equivalent or similar to those outlined in clause
              13.2(d);</li>
            <li><strong>f)</strong> if there is a change of control of the Client (where “control” has the meaning given
              to it in s1124 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010), and the person gaining control of the Client is, or
              controls, a direct competitor of Vizintel.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>13.3</strong> The termination or expiry of any Service shall not affect the continuation of any
            other Services under the Statement of Work or this Agreement.</p>

          <p><strong>13.4</strong> On termination of this Agreement for any reason:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>a)</strong> the Client shall immediately pay Vizintel for all Vizintel’s outstanding unpaid
              invoices, and, in respect of Services supplied and Expenses and costs incurred but not yet invoiced, or
              any Cancellation Charge, Vizintel may submit invoices, which shall be payable immediately on receipt;</li>
            <li><strong>b)</strong> on request, each party shall return all the other party’s materials, equipment, and
              other property;</li>
            <li><strong>c)</strong> the accrued rights and liabilities of the parties as at termination shall not be
              affected;</li>
            <li><strong>d)</strong> all licences granted under this Agreement shall immediately terminate;</li>
            <li><strong>e)</strong> on request, Vizintel shall provide the Client with copies of any Survey Data in a

            <li><strong>f)</strong> Vizintel may destroy or otherwise dispose of any of the Client Data in its

              this Agreement, a written request for the delivery to the Client of the then most recent back-up of the
              Client Data. Vizintel shall use reasonable commercial endeavours to deliver the back-up to the Client
              within 30 days of its receipt of such a written request. The Client shall pay all reasonable expenses
              incurred by Vizintel in returning or disposing of Client Data.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>13.5</strong> Provisions of this Agreement which are either expressed to survive its termination or
            which from their nature or context are contemplated to survive termination shall remain in full force and
            effect notwithstanding termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing,
            clauses 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, and 20 shall survive and continue to have full force and effect following
            termination.</p>


          <h2>14. NON-SOLICITATION</h2>

          <p><strong>14.1</strong> During this Agreement and for 12 months after its termination, neither party shall,
            without the other party’s written consent, solicit or entice, or attempt to solicit or entice (or encourage
            a third party to solicit or entice), any person who, at any point in either the preceding six months or the
            six months before termination (as applicable), was employed or engaged by the other party in the provision
            or receipt of the Services other than by means of a national advertising campaign open to all comers and not
            specifically targeted at any of the staff of the other party.</p>

          <p><strong>14.2</strong> A party recruiting a person in breach of clause 14.1 above shall immediately pay to
            the other party a sum representing 30% of the gross annual salary of the person recruited (calculated in
            relation to the salary that the employee was earning while employed by the non-defaulting party). If, for
            reasons of confidentiality, Vizintel requires the employee not to work during the notice period, the Client
            will additionally pay Vizintel a sum representing the salary payable in respect of the unfulfilled portion
            of the notice period.</p>

          <p><strong>14.3</strong> The parties confirm that the sums referred to in clause 14.2 are reasonable and
            proportionate to protect each party’s legitimate interest in ensuring each party’s performance of the
            Agreement and its strict compliance with clause 14.1.</p>

          <h2>15. FORCE MAJEURE</h2>

          <p><strong>15.1</strong> A party shall not be in breach of this Agreement, or be liable for any failure or
            delay in performance of any obligations under this Agreement (except in the case of a failure to pay), where
            such failure or delay arises or is attributable to acts, events, omissions, or accidents beyond its
            reasonable control (“Force Majeure”), including but not limited to fire, accidental damage, natural
            disaster, epidemic, pandemic, war, terrorist attack, riots, failure of machinery, computers or vehicles,
            industrial action, non-performance by suppliers or subcontractors (excluding companies in the same group as
            the party seeking to rely on this clause), or interruption or failure of utility service.</p>

          <p><strong>15.2</strong> A party subject to Force Majeure shall not be in breach of this Agreement provided it
            could not have avoided the effect of Force Majeure by taking precautions which it ought reasonably to have
            taken, and provided it promptly notifies the other party of the existence and nature of the Force Majeure,
            and uses reasonable endeavours to mitigate the effect of Force Majeure.</p>

          <p><strong>15.3</strong> If Force Majeure continues for more than 30 consecutive days, either party may
            terminate this Agreement immediately by giving written notice to the other party. Such termination shall be
            without prejudice to the rights of the parties in respect of any breach of this Agreement occurring before
            such termination.</p>

          <h2>16. NOTICES</h2>

          <p><strong>16.1</strong> A notice (other than a notice in any legal proceedings) given by one party to the
            other under this Agreement will be properly served if it is in English and sent to the appropriate address
            noted below.</p>

          <p><strong>16.2</strong> The following list sets out methods by which a notice may be sent and, if sent by
            that method, the corresponding deemed delivery date and time:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>a)</strong> Delivery by hand: On signature of a delivery receipt.</li>
            <li><strong>b)</strong> Pre-paid first-class recorded delivery post or other next working day delivery
              service providing proof of postage: 9.00 am on the second Business Day after posting.</li>

              posting.</li>
            <li><strong>d)</strong> Email sent to compliance@Vizintel.com: at the time of transmission, or, if this time
              falls outside Normal Business Hours in the place of receipt, when Normal Business Hours resume.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>16.3</strong> For the purpose of this clause and calculating deemed receipt, all references to time
            are to local time in the place of deemed receipt.</p>

          <p><strong>16.4</strong> The addresses for service of notice to the Client are as set out in the Statement of
            Work, and in the case of notices to Vizintel to the registered office address, with a copy to:</p>

          </ul>

          <p><strong>16.5</strong> This clause 16 does not apply to the service of any proceedings or other documents in
            any legal action or, where applicable, any arbitration or other method of dispute resolution.</p>

          <h2>17. ASSIGNMENT AND SUBCONTRACTING</h2>

          <p><strong>17.1</strong> Vizintel shall be entitled to sub-contract its performance of the Services provided
            that any sub-contracting shall not relieve Vizintel from its obligations to the Client under this Agreement.
          </p>

          <p><strong>17.2</strong> Subject to clause 17.1, neither party may assign, transfer, charge, or otherwise
            dispose of this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations arising hereunder without the prior written
            approval of the other party. Vizintel is, however, entitled to perform any Services under this Agreement
            through any company which is its holding company or the subsidiary of such holding company, and any act or
            omission of such company shall be deemed to be the act or omission of Vizintel. For the purposes of this
            clause, “holding company” and “subsidiary” shall be construed in accordance with the definition in section
            1159 of the Companies Act 2006.</p>

          <h2>18. MISCELLANEOUS</h2>

          <p><strong>18.1</strong> Vizintel may amend this Agreement and/or the Services for legal or regulatory
            reasons, or to reflect changes in its services or business practices. Subject to the foregoing, no variation
            of the Statement of Work shall be valid unless it is in writing and signed by a duly authorised officer of
            each of the parties. Vizintel shall provide notice of any significant changes to this Agreement and/or the
            Services in accordance with clause 16 above.</p>

          <p><strong>18.2</strong> A party’s failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right or remedy provided
            under this Agreement or by law shall not constitute a waiver of such, or preclude any further exercise of
            that or any other right or remedy.</p>

          <p><strong>18.3</strong> If any provision or part-provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid, illegal
            or unenforceable, that provision or part-provision shall, to the extent required, be deemed not to form part
            of the Agreement, and the validity and enforceability of the other provisions and part-provisions of the
            Agreement shall not be affected.</p>

          <p><strong>18.4</strong> A person who is not a party to this Agreement shall have no rights under the
            Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of it.</p>

          <p><strong>18.5</strong> If any dispute arises under or in connection with this Agreement, the parties will
            first attempt in good faith to settle such through negotiation rather than through legal proceedings. If the
            dispute is not resolved within 21 days of either party’s attempt to instigate such negotiations, it may be
            settled by the courts of competent jurisdiction under this Agreement.</p>

          <p><strong>18.6</strong> Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict or exclude the right of either party to seek
            injunctive relief against the other party.</p>

          <p><strong>18.7</strong> This Agreement, and any documents annexed to it and signed or initialled by the
            parties, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes any previous arrangement,
            understanding, or agreement between them relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. Each party
            acknowledges that, in entering into this Agreement, it does not rely on any statement, representation,
            assurance, undertaking, or warranty, whether negligently or innocently made (“Representation”), of any
            person (whether a party to this Agreement or not), other than as expressly set out in this Agreement. Each
            party agrees that the only remedies available to it arising out of or in connection with a Representation
            shall be for breach of contract. Nothing in this clause 18.7 shall limit or exclude any liability for fraud.
          </p>

          <p><strong>18.8</strong> This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when
            executed shall constitute a duplicate original, but all the counterparts shall together constitute the one
            Agreement.</p>

          <p><strong>18.9</strong> Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or shall operate to create a partnership or
            joint venture of any kind between the parties or to authorise either party to act as agent for the other,
            and neither party shall have authority to act in the name or on behalf of or otherwise to bind the other in
            any way.</p>

          <h2>19. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION</h2>

          <p><strong>19.1</strong> This Agreement, and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or
            its subject-matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by, and
            construed in accordance with, the law of England and Wales.</p>

          <p><strong>19.2</strong> The parties irrevocably agree that the courts of England and Wales shall have
            exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim that arises out of or in connection with this
            Agreement or its subject-matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims).</p>

          <h2>SCHEDULE 1</h2>
          <h3>Subscription Service Terms</h3>

          <p>The terms of this Schedule 1 shall apply in relation to any Subscription Service supplied under this

          <ol>
            <li>Subject to the Client’s full compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Vizintel hereby grants to the
              Client a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable right to permit the Authorised Users to Use the
              Platform during the Licence Term.</li>

            <li>Except as expressly agreed in the Statement of Work, the rights provided under this Schedule 1 are

            <li>Vizintel reserves the right to implement and maintain technical measures to control access to and detect
              unauthorised use of the Subscription Service at any time, provided that such measures shall not adversely

              Agreement.</li>

            <li>The Client shall ensure that the Authorised Users:</li>

            </ul>

            <li>The Client shall procure that each Authorised User shall select a secure password for use of the
              Platform and that each Authorised User shall keep such password secret, not share it with any other person

              User changes its password on at least a monthly basis.</li>

            <li>The Client shall not, and shall procure that each Authorised User shall not, during the course of its

                offensive due to its nature and potential harm including but not limited to content prohibited by law,
                making false statements, or content offensive or indecent.</li>
            </ul>

              <li><strong>(a)</strong> Except to the extent expressly permitted by this Agreement or any applicable law
                which is incapable of exclusion by agreement between the parties:</li>

              </ul>
              <li><strong>(b)</strong> During the Licence Term and for 12 months thereafter, access all or any part of
                the Platform in order to build or assist any third party to build a product or service which competes

                functional and technical aspects of the Subscription Service;</li>
              <li><strong>(c)</strong> Resell access to the Platform, or use the Platform in any provision of services

                as expressly permitted in this Schedule 1.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event that the Client is permitted in
              writing by Vizintel to resell access to, or otherwise make available, the Platform to a third party, the
              Client shall ensure that it enters into a binding written agreement with such third party with respect to
              the Platform materially equivalent to the terms of this Agreement.</li>

            <li>Vizintel shall use reasonable endeavours to make the Subscription Service available for Use in
              accordance with this Agreement, subject to:</li>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>(a)</strong> Client-caused outages or disruptions;</li>

                Vizintel has used reasonable endeavours to give the Client reasonable notice in advance of such
                unscheduled maintenance,</li>
            </ul>
            <p>and the Client’s sole and exclusive remedy in respect of a breach of this paragraph 9 shall be to receive
              the Support Services.</p>

            <li>The Client shall ensure that its network and systems comply with the relevant specifications provided by
              Vizintel from time to time.</li>

            <li>The Client undertakes to be solely responsible for procuring and maintaining its network connections and
              telecommunications links, and all problems, conditions, delays, delivery failures, and all other loss or

            <li> Vizintel:</li>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>a)</strong> does not warrant that the Client’s Use of the Subscription Service will be
                uninterrupted or error-free, or that the Subscription Service and/or Insights and/or any information
                and/or results obtained through the Subscription Service will meet the Client’s requirements; and</li>
              <li><strong>b)</strong> is not responsible for any delays, delivery failures, or any other loss or damage
                resulting from the transfer of data over communications networks and facilities outside of its
                reasonable ability to control, including the Internet, and the Client acknowledges that the Subscription
                Service may be subject to limitations, delays, and other problems inherent in the use of such
                communications facilities.</li>
            </ul>

            <li> The Client acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, it is
              inherent to the nature of the Subscription Service that the particular range of Insights available to the
              Client during the Licence Term may vary from time to time as the Subscription Service evolves and
              different data sources become or cease to be available. The availability or not of a particular range of
              Insights will not be a breach of this Agreement by Vizintel.</li>

            <li> The Client acknowledges that the Platform and/or the Insights may enable it to access the website
              content of, correspond with, and purchase products and services from, third parties via third-party
              websites and that it does so solely at its own risk. Vizintel has no control over such third-party
              products and services and shall have no liability or obligation whatsoever.</li>

            <li> Vizintel will treat any Client Data as the Confidential Information of the Client, and will not use or
              exploit it for its own commercial purposes. However, the Client acknowledges and agrees that the
              Subscription Service is not a zero-knowledge service, that Vizintel’s security measures may not be
              impregnable, and that the Subscription Service is not designed to be used as a repository of highly
              confidential materials. The Client therefore agrees that it shall not, and shall procure that Authorised
              Users shall not, upload to the Subscription Service any Client Data the disclosure of which to any third
              party would be likely to cause significant harm to the business of the Client, its Affiliates or its or
              their respective clients or suppliers.</li>

            <li>While Vizintel may, in the course of its own internal processes, incidentally take backups of the Client
              Data, the Client acknowledges and agrees that the Subscription Service is not a backup or disaster
              recovery service, and is not designed to hold the only copy of any Client Data. Therefore, the Client is
              solely responsible for ensuring that it has access to a backup copy of the Client Data in the event of any
              unavailability of the Platform.</li>

            <li>Vizintel reserves the right, without liability or prejudice to its other rights, to immediately suspend
              or terminate the Client’s and/or any or all of the Authorised Users’ right to Use the Subscription Service
              if the Client or any Authorised User breaches any of the provisions of this Agreement.</li>

            <li>Subject to clause 10 of the General Terms, the Client hereby defends, indemnifies, and holds harmless
              Vizintel against claims, actions, proceedings, losses, damages, expenses, and costs (including without
              limitation court costs and reasonable legal fees) arising out of or in connection with:</li>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>a)</strong> the use of the Subscription Service (including the Platform and Insights) by the
                Client and the Authorised Users other than in accordance with this Agreement; and</li>
              <li><strong>b)</strong> the use of the Client Data by Vizintel in accordance with this Agreement and the
                use of the Client Data by the Client and the Authorised Users.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Subject to clause 10 of the General Terms and 12.9 below, Vizintel hereby defends the Client against any
              third-party claim that the Platform and/or the Insights (excluding any Client Materials) infringe any
              copyright, trademark, database right, or right of confidentiality in the Territory (each, a “Third Party
              IP Claim”), and indemnifies the Client for any amounts awarded against the Client in judgment or
              settlement of such Third Party IP Claims.</li>

            <li>Subject to clause 10 of the General Terms, in no event shall Vizintel, its employees, agents, and
              sub-contractors be liable under or in connection with this Agreement to the extent that a Third Party IP
              Claim arises from or in connection with:</li>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>a)</strong> a modification of the Subscription Service and/or Insights by anyone other than
                Vizintel;</li>
              <li><strong>b)</strong> the Client’s or any Authorised User’s use of the Subscription Service or Insights
                in a manner contrary to the instructions given to the Client by Vizintel and/or in breach of this
                Agreement and/or the end-user licence agreement;</li>
              <li><strong>c)</strong> the combination of any aspect of the Subscription Service with some other product
                or service, if the alleged infringement would otherwise have been avoided; or</li>
              <li><strong>d)</strong> the Client’s or any Authorised User’s use of the Subscription Service and/or
                Insights after notice of the alleged or actual infringement from Vizintel or any appropriate authority.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <li>In the event of a Third-Party IP Claim, Vizintel shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (at its
              option):</li>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>a)</strong> obtain for the Client a right to continue to use the Platform and the Insights;
              </li>
              <li><strong>b)</strong> modify the Platform and/or the Insights so as to avoid the alleged infringement;
                or</li>
              <li><strong>c)</strong> if it is not commercially reasonable or practicable to do either of those things,
                terminate this Agreement and give the Client a pro-rata refund of any Fees paid in advance for any
                unexpired period of the Licence Term following such termination. Subject to clause 10 of the General
                Terms, the indemnity set out in paragraph 19 above and this paragraph 21 set out the Client’s sole and
                exclusive remedy in respect of any Third Party IP Claim.</li>
            </ul>
          </ol>

          <h4>2. Roles of the Parties and Processing Activities</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>2.1</strong> The parties acknowledge and agree that:</li>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>a)</strong> To the extent that Vizintel processes Client Personal Data on behalf of the Client
                in connection with the provision of Services, Vizintel shall be the processor and the Client shall be
                the controller with respect to such processing.</li>
              <li><strong>b)</strong> Vizintel may also, in the course of or in connection with the provision of
                Services, process certain personal data as a controller rather than the Client’s processor, in which
                case that personal data, when so processed by Vizintel, is not Client Personal Data, and the Client
                shall not be entitled to any data contained in such personal data.</li>
              <li><strong>c)</strong> Each party otherwise acts as an independent controller in relation to any personal
                data processed under or in connection with this Agreement.</li>
            </ul>

            <li><strong>2.2</strong> Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the subject-matter and duration of
              the processing carried out by Vizintel on behalf of the Client, the nature and purpose of the processing,
              the type of personal data, and categories of data subjects are accurately documented in Appendix 1 (which
              may from time to time be updated by the written agreement of the parties).</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>3. Obligations of Vizintel</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>3.1</strong> Vizintel shall only process the Client Personal Data in accordance with the
              documented instructions of the Client (including those documented in accordance with Appendix 1, as
              updated from time to time), unless required to do so by European Law to which Vizintel is subject, in
              which event Vizintel shall inform the Client of such legal requirement unless prohibited from doing so by
              European Law on important grounds of public interest.</li>

            <li><strong>3.2</strong> Vizintel shall ensure that any persons authorised by it to process the Client
              Personal Data are subject to an obligation of confidentiality.</li>
            <li><strong>3.3</strong> Vizintel shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to
              ensure that the Client Personal Data is subject to a level of security appropriate to the risks arising
              from its processing by Vizintel, taking into account the factors and measures referred to in Article 32 of
              the GDPR. Such security measures may include:</li>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>a)</strong> The pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data;</li>
              <li><strong>b)</strong> The ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and
                resilience of processing systems and services;</li>
              <li><strong>c)</strong> The ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely
                manner in the event of a physical or technical incident;</li>
              <li><strong>d)</strong> A process for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of
                the security measures.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>3.4</strong> Taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to
              Vizintel, Vizintel shall assist the Client with regard to the Client’s compliance with its obligations
              under the following Articles of the GDPR:</li>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>a)</strong> Article 32 (Security of processing);</li>
              <li><strong>b)</strong> Articles 33 and 34 (Notification and communication of a personal data breach);
              </li>
              <li><strong>c)</strong> Article 35 (Data protection impact assessment); and</li>
              <li><strong>d)</strong> Article 36 (Prior consultation by the Client with the supervisory authority).</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>3.5</strong> Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph 3.4, Vizintel shall notify the
              Client without undue delay (and in any event within 48 hours) after becoming aware of a personal data
              breach. Vizintel shall provide such co-operation, assistance, and information as the Client may reasonably
              require in respect of any personal data breach. Without prejudice to the generality of this requirement,
              Vizintel shall provide the Client with the following information in respect of any personal data breach
              (insofar as it is possible, at the time of notifying the Client of the relevant personal data breach, or
              where such information is not available at the point of notification as soon as such information is
              available):</li>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>a)</strong> The nature of the Client Personal Data, including where possible the categories
                and approximate number of data subjects concerned and the categories and number of personal data records
                concerned;</li>
              <li><strong>b)</strong> The likely consequences of the personal data breach;</li>
              <li><strong>c)</strong> The measures taken or proposed to be taken by Vizintel to address the personal
                data breach, including where appropriate measures to mitigate the possible adverse effects; and</li>
              <li><strong>d)</strong> The details of a contact point where more information concerning the personal data
                breach can be obtained.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>3.6</strong> In addition to the general notice terms under clause 16 of the General Terms, in
              the particular case of a personal data breach any notifications shall be addressed to and further
              communications sent to:</li>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>a)</strong> Clients’ Data Protection Contact: <a
                  href="mailto:compliance@Vizintel.com">compliance@Vizintel.com</a></li>
              <li><strong>b)</strong> Vizintel’s Data Protection Contact: <a
                  href="mailto:dpo@Vizintel.com">dpo@Vizintel.com</a></li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>3.7</strong> Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph 3.5, Vizintel will notify the
              Client without undue delay (and in any event within 48 hours) of any rights request it receives from a
              data subject pursuant to Chapter III of the GDPR. Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, Vizintel
              shall not respond to or fulfil such requests itself. Taking into account the nature of the processing,
              Vizintel shall assist the Client by appropriate technical and organisational measures, insofar as this is
              possible, for the fulfilment of the Client’s obligation to respond to such requests for exercising a data
              subject's rights under the GDPR.</li>
            <li><strong>3.8</strong> Upon the earlier of:</li>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>a)</strong> Termination or expiry of the Agreement; or</li>
              <li><strong>b)</strong> The date on which the Client Personal Data is no longer relevant to, or necessary
                for, the purposes of providing the relevant Services;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Vizintel shall deliver up or destroy (at the Client’s request) such Client Personal Data which is in the
              possession of, or under the control of, Vizintel unless European Law requires Vizintel to store such
              Client Personal Data.</p>
            <li><strong>3.9</strong> Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, Vizintel shall be entitled to
              appoint further processors to process the Client Personal Data (“Sub-processors”). The following shall
              apply in respect of the appointment of Sub-processors:</li>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>a)</strong> The Client shall be deemed to have approved the appointment of the Sub-processors
                documented in accordance with Appendix 1;</li>
              <li><strong>b)</strong> Vizintel shall notify the Client by email of its intention to engage any
                additional Sub-processor. Such notice shall give details of the identity of such Sub-processor and the
                services to be supplied by it;</li>
              <li><strong>c)</strong> Vizintel shall only use a Sub-processor that has provided sufficient guarantees to
                implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that the processing will
                meet the requirements of the Data Privacy Laws and ensures the protection of the rights of data
                subjects;</li>
              <li><strong>d)</strong> Vizintel shall impose, through a legally binding contract between Vizintel and the
                Sub-processor, data protection obligations on the Sub-processor that are in all material respects
                equivalent to those set out in this DPA (including, to the extent applicable, the requirements of
                paragraph 5) and which in any event meet the requirements set out in the Data Privacy Laws;</li>
              <li><strong>e)</strong> The Client shall be entitled to object to the proposed appointment of the
                Sub-processor where it reasonably considers that such appointment will not comply with the requirements
                of this paragraph 3.9. The Client shall be deemed to have approved the engagement of the Sub-processor
                if it has not served a notice in writing on Vizintel objecting to such an appointment within 14 days of
                the date that the notice is deemed to be received by the Client in accordance with paragraph 3.9(b);
              </li>
              <li><strong>f)</strong> Where the Client objects to the proposed appointment, Vizintel will use
                commercially reasonable efforts to continue to provide the Services without the use of the relevant
                Sub-processor. Where Vizintel is unable to continue to provide the Services despite having used such
                commercially reasonable efforts, Vizintel shall have no liability for any failure to provide the
                Services in accordance with the Agreement; and</li>
              <li><strong>g)</strong> Vizintel shall remain fully liable for all acts or omissions of the Sub-processors
                as if they were acts or omissions of Vizintel.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>3.10</strong> Vizintel shall keep at its normal place of business a written record of its
              processing of Client Personal Data and of its compliance with its obligations set out in this DPA
              (“Records”). Vizintel shall permit the Client, its third party representatives or a supervisory authority
              or its third party representatives access to inspect the Records and any other relevant information held
              at any premises or on systems used in connection with the processing of the Client Personal Data, for the
              purpose of auditing compliance with Vizintel’s obligations under this paragraph 3. Vizintel shall give any
              and all necessary assistance in respect of the conduct of such audits. Audits may be performed no more
              than once a year on no less than five (5) business days written notice and must be conducted during
              regular business hours and must not unreasonably interfere with Vizintel’s business.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>4. Obligations of the Client</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>4.1</strong> The Client shall ensure that:</li>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>a)</strong> The supply to Vizintel of Client Personal Data by or on behalf of the Client for
                the purposes of processing undertaken by Vizintel and its permitted Sub-processors shall comply with the
                Data Privacy Laws;</li>
              <li><strong>b)</strong> There is a lawful basis in respect of Vizintel’s (and any permitted
                Sub-processor’s) processing of the Client Personal Data and data subjects have been provided with a
                privacy policy or notice that complies with the requirements of Article 13 and/or 14 of the GDPR in
                respect of such processing; and</li>
              <li><strong>c)</strong> The instructions given by the Client to Vizintel by operation of paragraph 3.1
                shall comply with the Data Privacy Laws.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>

          <h4>5. Restricted Transfers</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>5.1</strong> <em>Between the parties</em>: The parties acknowledge and agree that the transfer
              from the Client to Vizintel of Client Personal Data does not constitute a Restricted Transfer. If and to
              the extent that such a transfer or processing of Client Personal Data becomes a Restricted Transfer, the
              parties shall enter into a separate addendum to implement a transfer mechanism to ensure that the
              Restricted Transfer complies with the International Transfer Requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>5.2</strong> <em>By Vizintel</em>: The Client acknowledges and agrees that Client Personal Data
              may be transferred by Vizintel to Sub-processors located in a Restricted Country, which may be considered
              a Restricted Transfer. In the event of the transfer being considered a Restricted Transfer, Vizintel shall
              enter into a transfer mechanism to ensure that the Restricted Transfer meets the International Transfer
              Requirements, and Vizintel shall provide details of the relevant transfer mechanism on request.</li>
            <li><strong>5.3</strong> <em>Failure of transfer mechanism</em>: The parties acknowledge and agree that to
              the extent either party considers (acting reasonably) that the use of the relevant lawful transfer
              mechanism relied on in respect of a Restricted Transfer under paragraph 5.2 is no longer an appropriate
              lawful transfer mechanism to legitimise the relevant Restricted Transfer pursuant to the International
              Transfer Requirements, the Restricted Transfer shall be suspended, and the parties shall work together in
              good faith to agree and put in place an alternative lawful transfer mechanism or such other supplementary
              measures to enable the Restricted Transfer to continue.</li>
            <li><strong>5.4</strong> In addition to paragraph 5.3, the parties will each use commercially reasonable
              efforts to ensure that the Services can continue to be provided in all material respects in accordance
              with the Agreement despite the suspension of the Restricted Transfer.</li>
            <li><strong>5.5</strong> Without prejudice to Supplier’s obligations under paragraphs 5.3 and 5.4, Vizintel
              shall have no liability under the Agreement for any inability to provide the relevant Services in
              accordance with the Agreement as a result of the suspension of a Restricted Transfer pursuant to paragraph
              5.3.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>6. Costs</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>6.1</strong> The Client acknowledges and agrees that the remuneration in respect of the Services
              does not take into account costs that may be incurred by Vizintel in complying with its obligations under
              this DPA. Accordingly, the Client will pay Vizintel in respect of any costs that are (or are to be)
              reasonably incurred by Vizintel outside the ordinary course of Vizintel’s business in respect of the
              performance by Vizintel of its obligations in this DPA, except where such performance is required as a
              result of a breach by Vizintel of its obligations under this DPA. Where practicable to do so, Vizintel
              will seek the Client’s written approval prior to incurring such costs.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>7. Liability for Losses</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>7.1</strong> Where, in accordance with the provisions under Article 82(3) of the GDPR, both
              parties are responsible for the act, or omission to act, resulting in the payment of Losses by a party or
              both parties, then a party shall only be liable for that part of such Losses which is in proportion to its
              respective responsibility.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>8. Use of Cookies</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>8.1</strong> Where the Services require Vizintel to collect Personal Data via the deployment of
              pixels, tags, and/or similar tracking technologies ("Tags") ("Interest Based Data") from any digital
              property owned and/or operated by Client (or by a third party on Client's behalf) ("Client Digital
              Property"), as neither Vizintel nor the relevant third-party data vendor engaged by Vizintel (“Data
              Vendor”) that provides the Tag has a direct relationship with the relevant Data Subjects, Client shall
              provide Vizintel with such cooperation and assistance as Vizintel and/or the Data Vendor may reasonably
              require to enable Vizintel and/or the Data Vendor to comply with its legal obligations. In particular,

            <ul>
              <li><strong>a)</strong> Assist Vizintel and/or the Data Vendor in ensuring there is a legal basis to

              <li><strong>b)</strong> Have in place, on each relevant Client Digital Property:</li>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>(i)</strong> A 'cookie banner' (or other appropriate mechanism) that complies with the
                  requirements of Data Privacy Laws and obtains consent (within the meaning of the GDPR) for and on
                  behalf of Vizintel and/or the Data Vendor for:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>(i) The deployment of Tags on the Data Subject's device(s); and</li>
                  <li>(ii) Vizintel's and/or the Data Vendor’s collection and processing of the Interest Based Data;
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>(ii)</strong> A privacy policy and cookie policy or notice that:</li>

                    receives the Data Subject's Personal Data for the purposes anticipated by the Agreement and/or the
                    applicable parts of Vizintel's and/or the Data Vendor’s privacy notice; and</li>
                  <li>(ii) Contains a clear and prominent link to Vizintel's and/or the Data Vendor’s privacy notice.

              </ul>
